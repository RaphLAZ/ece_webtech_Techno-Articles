# Project Techno ArticlesüöÄ

*Project as part of the web technologies course at the ECE School of Engineering*

The project is called "Techno Articles" and is a simple web application that allows users to create an account, create blog articles, and leave comments on other users' blog articles.

## How it worksüîß

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Supabase

## Functionalityüíª

The project has the following main features:

1. User authentication: users can create an account and log in to the application. Authentication is handled by Supabase, and users also have the option to authenticate with their Github account.
2. User profiles: users can view their own profiles, edit their own profiles.
3. Blog articles: users can create blog articles, edit their own blog articles, and delete their own blog articles.
4. Comments: users can leave comments on other users' blog articles, edit their own comments, and delete their own comments.

*üí°Our front-end application uses a Static Site Generator (SSG) to generate HTML pages from the source code.*

## Database schemaüóÇÔ∏è

The project uses a PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

- `users`: contains information about the application's users, including their email address, password (stored securely using bcrypt), and profile information.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE public.users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    job TEXT
);
```

- `articles`: contains information about the blog articles, including the post title, content, and author information.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE articles (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  author TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

*Function uuid_generate_v4() sets the default value of the id column to a newly generated UUID value.*

- `comments`: contains information about the comments on the blog articles, including the comment content, author information, and the post the comment was made on.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE comments (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    article_id uuid REFERENCES articles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

*Function uuid_generate_v4() sets the default value of the id column to a newly generated UUID value.*

- `contactrequest`: contains the data from the contact form that everyone can input data. Authenticated users as well as unauthenticated users of the blog.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE contactrequest (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

*Function uuid_generate_v4() sets the default value of the id column to a newly generated UUID value.*

*`created_at` column allows the admin to retrieve the oldest contact requests by sorting the table based on the created_at column in ascending order.*

### Triggers and functionsüîÑ

We've added triggers to our database for several needs.

- üëâThis trigger function is executed automatically after a new row is inserted into the "auth.users" table. The function inserts a new row into the "public.users" table with the same "id" and "email" as the new row in "auth.users" and then returns the new row.

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, email)
  VALUES (new.id, new.email);
  return new;
END;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  after insert ON auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

*The different functions and triggers were found on different blogs like STackOverFlow, SupabaseDocs and reused for our project.*

## Securityüõ°Ô∏è

Security is a top priority for this project, and we've implemented several measures to ensure that user data is protected. Supabase, the backend service used for this project, integrates with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, which allows us to define rules that restrict access to certain rows in the database based on user roles and permissions.

In the `users` table, we've set up the following RLS policies:

- `profile_visible_by_creator` - restricts access to user profile so that only the user who created the profile can view it.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY profile_visible_by_creator
ON users
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

- `update_own_profile` - allows users to update their own profile, but not the profiles of other users.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY update_own_profile
ON users 
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

In the `articles` table, we've set up the following RLS policies:

- `delete_own_post` - allows individuals to delete their own articles.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY delete_own_articles
ON articles 
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

- `update_own_post` - allows individuals to update their own articles.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY update_own_post
ON articles 
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

- `authenticated_insert` - restricts insertions into the table to authenticated users only.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY authenticated_insert
ON articles 
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

- `articles_are_public` - allows everybody to see the articles.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY public_articles
ON articles 
FOR SELECT
USING (true);
```

In the `comments` table, we've set up the following RLS policies:

- `public_comments` - allows comments to be visible to all users.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY public_comments
ON comments 
FOR SELECT
USING (true);
```

- `insert_comments` - allows authenticated/unauthenticated users to insert comment on a post.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY insert_comments
ON comments 
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);
```

- `delete_own_comment` - allows individuals to delete their own comments.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY delete_own_comments
ON comments 
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Finally, in the `contactrequest` table, we've allowed everyone to insert a contact request.

- `insert_contact_request` - allows everyone to insert a contact request even if they are not authenticated.

```SQL
CREATE POLICY insert_contact_request
ON contactrequest 
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);
```

By using RLS policies, we can ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data in the database, protecting user privacy and security.
