# Project Techno ArticlesðŸš€

*Project as part of the web technologies course at the ECE School of Engineering*

The project is called "Techno Articles" and is a simple web application that allows users to create an account, create blog articles, and leave comments on other users' blog articles.

## How it worksðŸ”§

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Supabase

## FunctionalityðŸ’»

The project has the following main features:

1. User authentication: users can create an account and log in to the application. Authentication is handled by Supabase, and users also have the option to authenticate with their Github account.
2. User profiles: users can view their own profiles, edit their own profiles.
3. Blog articles: users can create blog articles, edit their own blog articles, and delete their own blog articles.
4. Comments: users can leave comments on other users' blog articles, edit their own comments, and delete their own comments.

*ðŸ’¡Our front-end application uses a Static Site Generator (SSG) to generate HTML pages from the source code.*
